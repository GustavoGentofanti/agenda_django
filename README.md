# <h1 align="center"> :black_medium_square: Project Agenda with Django :black_medium_square: </h1>

Repository created for the project (Agenda). <br /> <br /> In this project, I used the Django, 
is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development,
so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.  <br /> <br />
In addition to, I used SQLite3, SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, 
full-featured, SQL database engine. <br /> <br />
